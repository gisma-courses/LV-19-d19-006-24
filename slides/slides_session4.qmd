## Spatial Patterns

In recent years, the ideas of analyzing spatial patterns have been extended through an approach called **pattern-based spatial analysis** [(Long in in. 2010; Cardille in in. 2010; Cardille in in. 2012; Jasiewicz i in. 2013; Jasiewicz i in. 2015)]{.smallcaps}.

The fundamental idea is to divide a big area into a large number of smaller areas which we may call local landscapes patches.

Note: The patch size is depending on spatial data resolution and scale of the landscape

::::: columns
::: {.column width="25%"}

:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
The idea is to represent each of this arbitrary areas using a statistical description of the spatial pattern - a **spatial signature**.

This spatial signatures can be **compared** using a large number of existing **distance or dissimilarity measures** [(Lin 1991; Cha 2007)]{.smallcaps}, which enables spatial analyses such as searching, change detection, clustering, or segmentation.

## Spatial Signatures


Most landscape metrics are single numbers representing specific features of a local landscape.

Spatial signatures, on the other hand, are multi-element representations of landscape composition and configuration.

The basic signature is the co-occurrence matrix:
