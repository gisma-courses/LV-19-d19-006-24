In the geosciences, remote sensing is the only measurement technique that allows complete coverage of large spatial areas, up to the entire Earth's surface.
Its successful application requires both the use of existing methods and the adaptation and development of new ones.

# Introduction

In geospatial or environmental informatics, the detection of changes to the Earth's surface using satellite, aircraft or drone images, known as change detection analysis, is an important application.
These results are often linked to biophysical, geophysical or anthropogenic processes in order to gain both a deeper understanding and the possibility of developing predictive models.
Methods of image analysis are of outstanding importance for generating spatial information from the underlying processes.
Since both the quantity and quality of this "image data" are playing an increasingly important role in environmental monitoring and modeling, it is becoming more and more necessary to integrate "big data" concepts into the analyses.
This means performing reproducible analyses with large amounts of data (\>\> 10 GB).
This is essential for both scientific knowledge gain and future societal challenges.

As already explained in the introduction, we start with a scalable change detection analysis of forest damage in low mountain ranges, which is a typical application-oriented task.
Scalable means that we limit the analysis to a manageable area, the Nordwestharz, and to two time slices.
However, the resulting algorithm can be applied to different or larger areas and to more time slices.

## Information from image data

Unprocessed satellite images are not necessarily informative.
While our eyes can interpret a true-color image relatively conclusively and intuitively, a reliable and reproducible, i.e. scientifically sound, interpretation requires other approaches.
A major advantage of typical image analysis methods over visual interpretation is the derivation of additional, so-called *invisible* information.
We have already calculated simple indices such as NDVI or surface albedo as a physically based conversion of image signals into a measured variable.

To obtain useful or meaningful information, e.g. about the land cover in an area, we have to analyze the data according to the question at hand.
Probably the best known and most widely used approach is the supervised classification of image data into categories of interest.

This tutorial introduces you to the classification of satellite and aerial image data.

We will cover the following topics:

1.  preparation of the working environment and loading of data
2.  digitization of the training areas
3.  unsupervised classification (kmeans clustering)
4.  model training
5.  supervised classification (Random Forest, Maximum Likelihood)
6.  estimation of model quality

# Classification of remote sensing data

Please note that all types of classification usually require extensive data pre-processing.
The focus is then on model building and quality assessment, which can be seen as the technical basis for classification, in order to finally derive the interpretation of the results in terms of content in the data post-processing.
We will go through this process step by step.

## Supervised classification

In supervised land cover classification, a model is derived from a limited amount of training land cover data that predicts land cover for the entire data set.
The land cover types are defined *a priori*, and the model attempts to predict these types based on the similarity between the characteristics of the training data and the rest of the data set.

![](images/supervised_classification.jpg)

From a pragmatic point of view, classification tasks generally require the following steps:

-   Creation of a comprehensive input data set that contains one or more raster layers. Selection of training areas, i.e. subsets of the input data set for which the land cover type is known to the remote sensing expert. Knowledge of the land cover can be obtained, for example, from one's own or third-party in situ observations, management information or other remote sensing products (e.g. high-resolution aerial photographs). Training a model using the training sites. For validation purposes, the training sites are often subdivided into one or more test and training sites to evaluate the performance of the model algorithm. Applying the trained model to the entire data set, i.e. predicting the land cover type based on the similarity of the data at each site to the class characteristics of the training data set.

## Start - Setting up the work environment

You can either use the data saved from the previous exercise or define, download and edit a new area.
However, the work environment is usually loaded first.

```{R setup , message = FALSE, warnings = FALSE}
#| eval: false
# ---- 0 Projekt Setup ----
require("pacman")
#remotes::install_github("zivankaraman/CDSE")
# packages installing if necessary and loading
pacman::p_load(mapview, mapedit, tmap, tmaptools, raster, terra, stars, gdalcubes, sf, dplyr,CDSE, downloader, tidyverse,RStoolbox,rprojroot, exactextractr, randomForest, ranger, e1071, caret, link2GI, rstac, OpenStreetMap,colorspace)
#--- Switch to determine whether digitization is required. If set to FALSE, the
root_folder = find_rstudio_root_file()

```

Please add any missing or defective packages in the above setup script (if error messages occur).
On the basis of the available Sentinel data, the first step should be to identify suitable data sets for a surface classification.

## Retrieving Sentinel data part 1 gdalcubes

Sentinel-2 is currently the most important platform for Earth observation in all areas, but especially for climate change, land use and ecological issues at all levels, from the upper micro to the global scale.

There are two operational Sentinel-2 satellites: Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, both in sun-synchronous polar orbits and 180 degrees out of phase. This arrangement allows them to cover the mid-latitudes with an orbital period of about 5 days.

The Sentinel-2 data are therefore predestined to record spatial and temporal changes on the Earth's surface (the forest was green in early summer, it has disappeared by late summer). They are ideal for timely studies before and after natural disasters, or for biomass balancing, etc.

## Cloud-Optimised GeoTIFFs (COGs)

Unfortunately, the official [Sentinel-2 archives](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/home) are anything but user-friendly. Even with very convenient tools such as [`sen2r`](https://sen2r.ranghetti.info/) it is sometimes tedious to process them.Technically, the processed product levels are available for download pre-processed as L1C and L2A products in JP2K format. The preferred file format is JP2K, which is storage efficient but has to be downloaded in its entirety locally by the user, resulting in high access costs and huge local storage requirements. The cloud-optimised GeoTIFFs (COGs) allow only the areas of interest to be downloaded and are also much faster to process. However, this requires optimised cloud services and a technically different access logic than in the processing chains used so far.

## SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC)

The [Spatial-Temporal Asset Catalogue] (https://stacspec.org/) (STAC) provides a common language for simplified indexing and discovery of geospatial data. A "Spatio-Temporal Asset" is a file that contains information in a specific space and time.

This approach allows any provider of spatio-temporal data (imagery, SAR, point clouds, data cubes, full motion video, etc.) to provide Spatio-Temporal Asset Catalogues (STAC) for their data. STAC focuses on an easy-to-implement standard that organisations can use to make their data available in a durable and reliable way.

[Element84](https://www.element84.com/) has provided a public API called Earth-search, a central search catalogue for all public AWS datasets using STAC (including the new Sentinel-2 COGs), which contains more than 11.4 million Sentinel-2 scenes worldwide as of 1 November 2017.

# Goals

This example shows how complex times series methods from external R packages can be applied in cloud computing environments using [`[rstac`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rstac) [@rstac] and [`gdalcubes`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=gdalcubes) [@gdalcubes]. We will use the [`bfast` R package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bfast) containing unsupervised change detection methods identifying structural breakpoints in vegetation index time series. Specifically, we will use the `bfastmonitor()` function to monitor changes on a dedicated timeperiod of a time series of Sentinel-2 imagery.

Other packages used in this tutorial include [`stars`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=stars) [@stars], [`tmap`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tmap) [@tmap] and [mapview](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tmap) [@mapview] for creating interactive maps, [`sf`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sf) [@sf] for processing vector data, and [`colorspace`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=colorspace) [@colorspace] for visualizations with accessible colors.

Various approaches to time series and difference analyses with different indices will be applied using the example of the MOF AOI for the time period 1997 - 2021.

## Defining the Area of Interest

One major challenge is the fact that most of the earth surface related remote sensing activities are heavily *"disturbed"* by the atmosphere, especially by clouds. So to find cloud free satellite imagery is a common and cumbersome task. This task is supported by the `rstac` package which provides a convenient tool to find and filter adequate Sentinel-2 images out of the COG data storage. However, to address the AOI we need to provide the extend via the `bbox` argument of the corresponding function `stac_search()`. So first we need to derive and transform the required bounding box to WGS84 geo-coordinates, easily done with the `sf` functions `st_bbox()` and `st_transform()`. In addition we adapt the projection of the referencing vector objects to all other later projection needs.


Please note to project to three different CRS is for this examples convenience and clarity and somewhat superfluous. Only the corner coordinates of the sections are required and not the complete geometries. However, it creates more clarity for the later process to already have the data needed in different projections.\


```{r geometries}
library(tmap)
library(tmaptools)
library(sf)
utils::download.file(url="https://github.com/gisma/gismaData/raw/master/MOF/MOF_CORE.gpkg",destfile="../data/MOF_CORE.gpkg")

forest_mask = sf::st_read("../data/MOF_CORE.gpkg")
sf::st_crs(forest_mask) <- 4326
fm=bb(forest_mask,projection=4326)
forest_4326 =sf::st_transform(forest_mask,crs = 4326)
forest_3035 =sf::st_transform(forest_mask,crs = 3035)
forest_32632 =sf::st_transform(forest_mask,crs = 32632)


# mapping the extents and boundaries of the choosen geometries
tmap_mode("view")
tmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE) + 
  tm_basemap(server = c("Esri.WorldGrayCanvas", "OpenStreetMap", "Esri.WorldTopoMap","Esri.WorldImagery")) +
  tm_shape(forest_mask) +   
  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.4, col="mainTreeSp")
```

Our study area is pretty small, covering roughly 2.5 by 2.5 km forest area northwest of Marburg. The core part of the AOI is the Marburg Open Forest (MOF) a field research facility of the Philipps University Marburg.

### Querying images with `rstac`

Using the `rstac` package, we first request all available images from 2017 to 2020 that intersect with our region of interest. Here, since the polygon has WGS84 as CRS, we do **not** need to transform the bounding box before using the `stac_search()` function.

```{r stac2}
# search the data stack for the given period and area
library(rstac)

s = stac("https://earth-search.aws.element84.com/v0")
items <- s |>
  stac_search(collections = "sentinel-s2-l2a-cogs",
              bbox = c(st_bbox(forest_4326)["xmin"],
                       st_bbox(forest_4326)["ymin"],
                       st_bbox(forest_4326)["xmax"],
                       st_bbox(forest_4326)["ymax"]), 
              datetime = "2018-01-01/2022-12-31",
              limit = 1000) |>
  post_request() 
items

# print date and time of first and last images
range(sapply(items$features, function(x) {x$properties$datetime}))
```

This gives us 315 matching images recorded between Januar 2019 and December 2023.

### Creating a monthly Sentinel-2 data cube

To obtain a Sentinel data cube, a gdalcube image collection must be created from the STAC query result. To do this, the asset names must be explicitly named in order to apply the SCL channel with the quality characteristics per pixel (classification as clouds, cloud shadows, etc.). In this query, a filter is set to cloud cover <= 50%.

```{r add_cube_assets}
library(gdalcubes)
assets = c("B01","B02","B03","B04","B05","B06", "B07","B08","B8A","B09","B11","SCL")
s2_collection = stac_image_collection(items$features, asset_names = assets, property_filter = function(x) {x[["eo:cloud_cover"]] < 50}) 
s2_collection
```

The result is 107 images, i.e. approx. 1.8 images per month, from which we can now create a data cube. To do this, we use the UTM bounding box of our polygon as a spatial boundary, a spatial resolution of 10 metres, a bilinear spatial interpolation (useful for the spatially lower-resolution sentinel channels) and calculate monthly median values for all pixel values from the available images of a month. In addition, we add a buffer (b) on each side of the cube.





The *gdalcube image collection* can be considered as a proxy structure object which will be applied on the COGs.


```{r create_cubeview, messages=FALSE, warnings=FALSE}
b = 100
v = cube_view(srs = "EPSG:32632", 
              dx = 10, 
              dy = 10, 
              dt = "P1M",  
              aggregation = "median", 
              extent = list(t0 = "2018-01-01",
                            t1 = "2022-12-31", 
                            left = st_bbox(forest_32632)["xmin"] - b, 
                            right = st_bbox(forest_32632)["xmax"] + b,
                            bottom = st_bbox(forest_32632)["ymin"] - b, 
                            top = st_bbox(forest_32632)["ymax"] + b),
              resampling = "bilinear")
v
```

Next we create a data cube, subset the red and near infrared bands and crop by our polygon, which simply sets pixel values outside the polygon to NA. We then save the data cube as a single netCDF file. Note that this is not necessary, but saving intermediate results sometimes makes debugging easier, especially if the methods applied afterwards are computationally intensive.


Only calling a final *action* will start the processing on the COG-Server. In this case 'write_ncdf'.


```{r get_data_write_ncdf}
# we "download" the data and write it t a netcdf file
  s2.mask = image_mask("SCL", values = c(3,8,9))
  gdalcubes_options(parallel = 16, ncdf_compression_level = 5)
  raster_cube(s2_collection, v, mask = s2.mask) |>
    write_ncdf("../data/MOF_10_2.nc",overwrite=TRUE)
```

In the following examples we will show a simple plot in a generic pipe. However, a more common visualisation is quite simple. A typical pipe might be Save a resulting netCDF file `->` Convert it to a `stars` object `->` Visualise the results with `tmap`, `mapview`, `ggplot2` or whatever package you prefer to produce (interactive) map(s).

## Reductions

Possible *reducers* include `min"`, `mean"`, `median"`, `max"`, `count"` (count non-missing values), `sum"`, `var"` (variance), and `sd"` (standard deviation). Reducer expressions are always given as a string, starting with the reducer name, followed by the band name in parentheses. Note that it is possible to mix reducers and bands.

### Counting

To get an idea of the data, we can compute simple summary statistics using a 'reducer' function over dimensions. For example, using the `count` reducer, we can learn about the temporal coverage for each aggregated pixel, giving us an initial understanding of the temporal quality of the dataset.

```{r count, messages=FALSE, warnings=FALSE}

ncdf_cube("../data/MOF_10_2.nc") |>
  reduce_time("count(B04)") |> 
  plot(key.pos = 1,  col = viridis::viridis, nbreaks = 10)
```

We can see that most time series contain valid observations of around 60 months, which should be sufficient for our example. Similarly, it is also possible to reduce over space, leading to summary time series.

Below you will find various examples dealing with the common NDVI and the [kNDVI](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/9/eabc7447) Indices.

### kNDVI

Below, we derive mean monthly kNdvi values over all pixel time series.

```{r forest_kndvi, messages=FALSE, warnings=FALSE}

ncdf_cube("../data/MOF_10_2.nc") |>
    apply_pixel("tanh(((B08-B04)/(B08+B04))^2)", "kNDVI") |>
  reduce_time("mean(kNDVI)") |>
  plot(key.pos = 1,  col = ndvi.col, nbreaks = 12)
```

## NDVI

Below, we derive mean monthly Ndvi values over all pixel time series.

```{r forest_ndvi, messages=FALSE, warnings=FALSE}
ncdf_cube("../data/MOF_10_2.nc") |>
  apply_pixel("(B08-B04)/(B08+B04)", "NDVI") |>
  reduce_time("mean(NsDVI)") |>
  plot(key.pos = 1, zlim=c(-0.2,1), col = ndvi.col, nbreaks = 12)
```

### Preparation of the data

As soon as the download has been successful, the actual classification can begin.
First, the data must be organized in a technically suitable way as a multichannel image.
In addition, a current or temporally corresponding Corine land use data set is loaded to generate a binary forest/non-forest mask.
The already available Copernicus account can be used to download the Corine data (https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/corine-land-cover).
After the (manual) download, unzip the data into the subdirectory 'level0' (be careful, there are countless subdirectories here after unzipping the archive).
We need the file `U2018_CLC2018_V2020_20u1.tif`.
Alternatively, the already correctly processed and projected \*data set from the github repository (see script) can be used.

```{R stack, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE}
#| eval: false
#--- Reading the data from the directories

##--- This describes how to process the Corine land use and land cover dataset
## The necessary file can also be downloaded from the repository
## An account is required for the download https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/corine-land-cover
## Therefore, download the data manually and copy it into the directory and unzip it
## Then execute the commented snippet below

# corine_eu = raster(file.path(envrmt$path_data_lev0,"u2018_clc2018_v2020_20u1_raster100m/DATA/U2018_CLC2018_V2020_20u1.tif"))

# corine_crop = raster::crop(corine_eu,tmp)
# corine_utm = projectRaster(corine_crop,crs = crs(pred_stack_2019))
# corine = resample(corine_utm,pred_stack_2019[[1]])

### First impression – K-means cluster classification

Probably the best-known unsupervised classification technique is K-means clustering, which is also referred to as the *"simplest machine learning algorithm"*.
It is often used to obtain an initial overview of whether the raster data can be sufficiently separated in feature space.

In our example (applied to 5 classes and executed with the function `unsuperClass` from the `RStoolbox` package), this looks as follows.
The cluster algorithm can achieve a fairly acceptable separation of the clearings/bald spots with 5 clusters, which makes a classification seem promising.
Also experiment with other cluster settings and discuss the results.

```{R}
#| eval: false
## k-means über RStoolbox
# Modell
prediction_kmeans_2019 = RStoolbox::unsuperClass(pred_stack_2019, nClasses = 5,norm = TRUE, algorithm = "MacQueen")
# Klassifikation
plot(prediction_kmeans_2019$map)

prediction_kmeans_2020 = RStoolbox::unsuperClass(pred_stack_2020, nClasses = 5,norm = TRUE, algorithm = "MacQueen")
plot(prediction_kmeans_2020$map)
```

## Step 2 - Generating training data

For a supervised classification, we need data that indicates which surface class defined areas of the satellite image belong to.
This data is referred to as training data and is very often obtained by manual digitization.
This can be done quite comfortably in RStudio if only a few training areas have to be digitized quickly and effectively.

For larger tasks, it makes sense to use the convenient method described in the QGIS 3.16 documentation, for example in the [digitizing tutorial](https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/training_manual/create_vector_data/create_new_vector.html#basic-ty-digitizing-polygons).

## Digitizing training data

We assume that we want to classify two types of land cover: *clearcut* and *other*.
With mapedit, each class must be digitized individually.
Once the training areas are available as vector data, the features of the respective raster stack can be extracted into a table according to the digitized classes and corrected for possible missing values.



If this part has already been completed, the logical variable *digitize* (defined at the beginning of the script) can be set to *FALSE* and the *else* part of the branch can be run – in other words, only the existing data is read.


## Excursus: Creating training areas with mapedit 

### Using color composites for better training results

For this exercise, we use `mapedit`, a small but powerful package that allows you to digitize and edit vector data in Rstudio or an external browser.
In combination with `mapview`, any \[color composite\] (https://custom-scripts.sentinel-hub.com/custom-scripts/sentinel-2/composites/) can also be used as a basis for digitization.

```{R}
#| eval: false

m1 = tm_shape(pred_stack_2019) + tm_rgb(r=4, g=3, b=2) +
  tm_layout(legend.outside.position = "right",
            legend.outside = T,
            panel.label.height=0.6,
            panel.label.size=0.6,
            panel.labels = c("r=1, g=2, b=3")) +
  tm_grid()

m2 = tm_shape(pred_stack_2019) + tm_rgb(r=8, g=4, b=3) +
  tm_layout(legend.outside.position = "right",
            legend.outside = T,
            panel.label.height=0.6,
            panel.label.size=0.6,
            panel.labels = c("r=8, g=4, b=3")) +
  tm_grid()
tmap::tmap_arrange(m1,m2)
  
```

![](images/rgb.png)

The planes can be switched using the plane control.
In true-color composites, the visible spectral channels Red (B04), Green (B03), and Blue (B02) are mapped to the corresponding red, green, and blue color channels, respectively, producing an image of the surface that closely resembles the natural "color" as it would be seen by a human sitting on the spacecraft.
False color images are often created using the spectral channels for near-infrared, red, and green.
They are particularly useful for assessing vegetation because plants reflect near-infrared and green light while absorbing red light (red-edge effect).
Dense vegetation appears a darker red.
Cities and open ground appear gray or light brown, water appears blue or black.

```{R digitize, echo=TRUE}
#| eval: false

#---- Digitization of training data ----

if (digitize) {
# For the supervised classification, we need training areas. You can digitize them as shown below or alternatively use QGis, for example

# clearcut

# maxpixels has significantly higher memory requirements, vegetation in red

# other: all areas not belonging to clear cutting as representative as possible

train_areas_2019_2020 <- rbind(clearcut_2019,clearcut_2020, other_2019,other_2020) # Reproject to the raster file
train_areas_2019 = sf::st_transform(train_areas_2019_2020,crs = sf::st_crs(pred_stack_2019))
mapview(filter(train_areas_2019_2020,year==2019), zcol="class")
# save geometries
st_write(train_areas_2019_2020,paste0(envrmt$path_data,"train_areas_2019_2020.gpkg"))

# Extract the training data for the digitized areas
tDF_2019 = exactextractr::exact_extract(pred_stack_2019, filter(train_areas_2019_2020,year==2019), force_df = TRUE,
include_cell = TRUE,include_xy = TRUE,full_colnames = TRUE,include_cols = "class")

# again, copy together into a file
tDF_2019 = dplyr::bind_rows(tDF_2019)
tDF_2019$year = 2019
tDF_2020 = dplyr::bind_rows(tDF_2020)
tDF_2020$year = 2020
# Delete any rows that contain NA (no data) values
tDF_2019 = tDF_2019[complete.cases(tDF_2019) ,]
tDF_2020 = tDF_2020[complete.cases(tDF_2020) ,]

tDF= rbind(tDF_2019,tDF_2020)

# check the extracted data
summary(tDF)

# Save as R internal data format
# is stored in the repo and can therefore be loaded (line below)
saveRDS(tDF, paste0(envrmt$path_data,"tDF.rds"))



} else {
tDF = readRDS(paste0(envrmt$path_data,"tDF.rds"))
}
```

The result is a table with training data for 2019 and 2020.
The data set contains all raster information for all bands covered by the polygons for the classes "clearcut" and "other".

```{R raw_train, echo=TRUE}
#| eval: false
head(tDF)
```


## Step 3 - Model training, testing model quality, classification

Classifiers (e.g. the maximum likelihood classifier) or machine learning algorithms (such as Random Forest) use the training data to determine descriptive models that represent statistical signatures, classification trees or other functions.
Within the limits of the quality of the training data, such models are suitable and representative for making predictions for areas if the predictors from the model are available for the entire area.

We now want to predict the spatial characteristics of clear-felling/no forest using a maximum likelihood classification and random forest, and apply standard methods of random validation and model quality assessment.

The goal is to separate clearcuts from all other pixels and to quantify the differences between 2019 and 2020.

### Maximum Likelihood Classification

Maximum likelihood classification assumes that the distribution of data for each class and in each channel is normally distributed.
Under this assumption, the probability that a particular pixel belongs to a particular class is calculated.
Since the probabilities can also be specified as a threshold, without this restriction, *all* pixels are assigned regardless of how unlikely they are.
Each pixel is assigned to the class that has the highest probability (i.e., the maximum probability).

![](images/max.png)

Since the maximum likelihood algorithm requires training data, it is a supervised learning method.
This means that we, as users, have to provide the algorithm with data that conveys knowledge about the classes to be predicted.
This data is then divided into training and test data.

```{R maxlike , message = FALSE, warnings = FALSE}
#| eval: false
# ---- Maximum Likelihood Classification ----

tDF = readRDS(paste0(envrmt$path_data,"tDF.rds"))

## Here the Random Forest is accessed via the caret utility package
# Setting a "seed" enables reproducible randomness
set.seed(123)

# Randomly draw 15% of the data (training/test)
idx = createDataPartition(tDF$class,list = FALSE,p = 0.05)
trainDat = tDF[idx,]
testDat = tDF[-idx,]

# Response variable (= "class" column) must be of the "factor" data type
trainDat$class <- as.factor(trainDat$class)
testDat$class <- as.factor(testDat$class)


# superClass() function from the RSToolbox package requires the table to be converted into the
# required (old) SpatialdataPoint object

sp_trainDat = trainDat
sp_testDat = testDat 
sp::coordinates(sp_trainDat) = ~x+y
sp::coordinates(sp_testDat) = ~x+y
crs(sp_trainDat) = crs(pred_stack_2019)
crs(sp_testDat) = crs(pred_stack_2019)


# superClass method "mlc" trains the model and then classifies it
#raster::beginCluster(30)
prediction_mlc_2019 <- superClass(pred_stack_2019, trainData = sp_trainDat[,1:16],valData = sp_testDat[,1:16], responseCol = "class", model = "mlc", tuneLength = 1, trainPartition = 0.3,verbose = TRUE)

prediction_mlc_2020 <- superClass(pred_stack_2020, trainData = sp_trainDat[,1:16],valData = sp_testDat[,1:16], responseCol = "class",model = "mlc", tuneLength = 1, trainPartition = 0.3,verbose = TRUE)
saveRDS(prediction_mlc_2019, paste0(envrmt$path_data,"prediction_mlc_2019.rds"))
saveRDS(prediction_mlc_2020, paste0(envrmt$path_data,"prediction_mlc_2020.rds"))
```

### Random forest

Random forests can be used for both regression and classification tasks, with the latter being particularly relevant in environmental remote sensing.
Like any machine learning method, the random forest model learns to recognize patterns and structures in the data itself.
Since the random forest algorithm also requires training data, it is also a supervised learning method.
![](images/Random_forest_diagram_complete.png)!

A random forest algorithm learns from the data by creating random decision trees – hence the name.
For classification tasks, the algorithm takes a suitable instance of a decision tree from the training data set and assigns the corresponding class to the pixel.
This is repeated with all available decision trees.
Finally, the pixel is assigned to the class that has the most trees, according to the winner-takes-all principle.

```{R random_forest, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=FALSE, warnings=FALSE}
#| eval: false

# Settings for model training: cross-validation, 10 repetitions
ctrlh = trainControl(method = "cv",
                     number = 10,
                     savePredictions = TRUE)

#--- random forest model training
rf_model = train(trainDat[,2:16], # Columns 2 to 16 contain the training data (called predictors)
trainDat[,1], # Column 1 contains the variable to be classified (called response)
method = "rf", # Method here rf for random forest
metric = "Kappa", # quality/performance measure KAppa
trControl = ctrlh, # the training control generated above is to be read in
importance = TRUE) # The importance of the variables is also saved

rf_model

#saveRDS(rf_model, paste0(envrmt$path_data,"rf_model.rds"))
```

### Estimation model quality

The test data are now used for the independent quality check of the model.
A confusion matrix indicates how accurately the model predicts the correct classes.
The main diagonal of the matrix indicates the cases in which the model applies.
In our classification of only two classes, however, a special case applies: [evaluation of a binary classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_of_binary_classifiers).
Detailed explanations for the function used here can be found in the [caret help](https://topepo.github.io/caret/measuring-performance.html#measures-for-predicted-classes).

The main statements about model quality are:

-   *'Positive' Class* = **clearcut**: is measured with the sensitivity (*true positive rate*), which indicates the probability that a positive object is correctly classified as positive.
-   *'Negative Class'* = **other**: is measured with the specificity (*true negative rate*) and indicates the probability that a negative object is correctly classified as negative.
-   *Positive and negative predictive values* indicate the actual performance for *clearcut* and *other*. They are corrected for the actual frequency distribution and are a measure of the precision and performance of the model with regard to the respective classes.

Despite the high values, we see that the *clearcut* class drops off significantly here.
This can certainly be taken as an indication of the need to improve the classification.

Overall, however, the model can be considered good.

```{R konfusiomatrix2019, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE}
#| eval: false
# ----Calculation of the confusion matrix  ----
cm_rf <- confusionMatrix(data = predict(rf_model, newdata = testDat), testDat$class)
cm_rf
```

### Prediction on the original data

Now we are ready to apply the verified model to our data set.
In remote sensing, this is usually called classification.

```{R klassifikation2019, message = FALSE, warnings = FALSE}
#| eval: false
# Klassifikation (auch Vorhersage genannt)
prediction_rf_2019  = raster::predict(pred_stack_2019 ,rf_model)
prediction_rf_2020  = raster::predict(pred_stack_2020 ,rf_model)
saveRDS(prediction_rf_2019, paste0(envrmt$path_data,"prediction_rf_2019.rds"))
saveRDS(prediction_rf_2020, paste0(envrmt$path_data,"prediction_rf_2020.rds"))

```

```{R vergleichklassifikationen}
#| eval: false
prediction_rf_2019 = readRDS(paste0(envrmt$path_data,"prediction_rf_2019.rds"))
prediction_rf_2020 = readRDS(paste0(envrmt$path_data,"prediction_rf_2020.rds"))
prediction_mlc_2019 = readRDS(paste0(envrmt$path_data,"prediction_mlc_2019.rds"))

A visual comparison shows that the Random Forest and Maximum Likelihood classifications provide results of comparable quality.
But does this impression stand up to quantitative analysis?
