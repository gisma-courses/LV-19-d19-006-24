    "text": "Achieving reliable monitoring hinges on the reproducibility of both field data collection and subsequent analyses. In the context of spatial micro-scale analysis and modeling, the precise geo-object locations play a central role, presenting an additional challenge when considering the 3D structure. Incorporating the temporal aspect, such as accurately recording repeated flights, further elevates these demands. Whether utilizing low-cost or professional UAV systems, these factors must be acknowledged to enable meaningful analysis or modeling. While LiDAR systems are the preferred choice for acquiring forest structure, their high cost, both in acquisition and processing, poses challenges. A feasible alternative lies in off-the-shelf UAV systems with integrated image acquisition. These systems allow for the generation of not only orthorectified planar image data but also quasi-three-dimensional point clouds through photo reconstruction and image processing techniques, providing elevation information for each coordinate."

External drift kriging and regression kriging, in particular, are fundamental techniques that use spatial autocorrelation and covariate information, i.e. sophisticated regression statistics.\nMachine learning algorithms like random forest have become very popular for spatial environmental prediction. One major reason for this is that they are can take into account non-linear and complex relationships, i.e. compensate for certain disadvantages that are present in the usual regression methods.",

    "text": "Proximity concepts\n\nVoronoi polygons – dividing space geometrically\nVoronoi polygons (aka Thiessen polygons) are an elementary method for geometrically determining proximity or neighborhoods. Voronoi polygons (see figure below) divide an area into regions that are closest to a given point in a set of irregularly distributed points. In two dimensions, a Voronoi polygon encompasses an area around a point, such that every spatial point within the Voronoi polygon is closer to this point than to any other point in the set. Such constructs can also be formed in higher dimensions, giving rise to Voronoi polyhedra.\n&lt;/frame&gt;\n&lt;iframe width=\"780\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://geomoer.github.io/geoAI//assets/images/unit01/suisse6.html\" title=\"Interpol\"&gt;\n\n\nThe blue dots are a typical example of irregularly distributed points in space – in this case, rain gauges in Switzerland. The overlaid polygons are the corresponding Voronoi segments that define the corresponding closest geometrical areas (gisma 2021)“\n\n\nSince Voronoi polygons correspond to an organizational principle frequently observed in both nature (e.g. plant cells) and in the spatial sciences (e.g. central places , according to Christaller), there are manifold possible applications. Two things must be assumed, however: First, that nothing else is known about the space between the sampled locations and, second, that the boundary line between two samples is incomplete idea.\nVoronoi polygons can also be used to delineate catchment areas of shops, service facilities or wells, like in the example of the Soho cholera outbreak. Please note that within a polygon, one of the spatial features is isomorphic, i.e. the spatial features are identical.\nBut what if we know more about the spatial relationships of the features? Let’s have a look at some crucial concepts.\n\n\nSpatial interpolation of data\nSpatially interpolating data points provides us with a modeled quasi-continuous estimation of features under the corresponding assumptions. But what is spatial interpolation? Essentially, this means using known values to calculate neighboring values that are unknown. Most of these techniques are among the most complex methods of spatial analysis, so we will deliberately limit ourselves here to a basic overview of the methods. Some of the best-known and common interpolation methods found in spatial sciences are nearest neighbor inverse distance, spline interpolations, kriging, and regression methods.\n\n\nContinously filling the gaps by interpolation\nTo get started, take a look at the following figure, which shows six different interpolation methods to derive the spatial distribution of precipitation in Switzerland (in addition to the overlaid Voronoi tessellation).\n\n\n\nThe blue dots are a typical example of irregularly distributed points in space – in this case, rain gauges in Switzerland. The size of each dot corresponds to the amount of precipitation in mm. The overlaid polygons are the corresponding Voronoi segments that define the corresponding closest geometrical areas (gisma 2021)” top left: Nearest neighbor interpolation based on 3-5 nearest neighbors, top right: Inverse Distance weighting (IDW) interpolation method middle left: AutoKriging with no additional parameters, middle right: Thin plate spline regression interpolation method bottom left: Triangular irregular net (TIN) surface interpolation, bottom right: additive model (GAM) interpolation\n\n\nIn the example of precipitation in Switzerland, the positions of the weather stations are fixed and cannot be freely chosen.\nWhen choosing an appropriate interpolation method, we need to pay attention to several properties of the samples (distribution and properties of the measurement points):\n\nRepresentativeness of measurement points: The sample should represent the phenomenon being analyzed in all of its manifestations.\nHomogeneity of measurement points: The spatial interdependence of the data is a very important basic requirement for further meaningful analysis.\nSpatial distribution of measurement points: The spatial distribution is of great importance. It can be completely random, regular or clustered.\nNumber of measurement points: The number of measurement points depends on the phenomenon and the area. In most cases, the choice of sample size is subject to practical limitations.\n\nWhat makes things even more complex is that these four factors – representativeness, homogeneity, spatial distribution and size – are all interrelated. For example, a sample size of 5 measuring stations for estimating precipitation for all of Switzerland is hardly meaningful and therefore not representative. Equally unrepresentative would be selecting every measuring station in German-speaking Switzerland to estimate precipitation for the entire country. In this case, the number alone might be sufficient, but the spatial distribution would not be. If we select every station at an altitude below 750 m asl, the sample could be correct in terms of both size and spatial distribution, but the phenomenon is not homogeneously represented in the sample. An estimate based on this sample would be clearly distorted, especially in areas above 750 m asl. In practice, virtually every natural spatially-continuous phenomenon is governed by stochastic fluctuations, so, mathematically speaking, it can only be described in approximate terms.\n\n\nMachine learning\nMachine learning (ML) methods such as random forest can also produce spatial and temporal predictions (i.e. produce maps from point observations). These methods are particularly robust because they take spatial autocorrelation into account, which can improve predictions or interpolations by adding geographic distances. This ultimately leads to better maps with much more complex relationships and dependencies.\nIn the simplest case, the results are comparable to the well-known model-based geostatistics. The advantage of ML methods over model-based geostatistics, however, is that they make fewer assumptions, can take non-linearities into account and are easier to automate.\n\n\n\nThe original dataset (top left) is a terrain model reduced to 8 meters with 48384 single pixels. For interpolation, 1448 points were randomly drawn and interpolated with conventional kriging (top right), support vector machines (SVM) (middle left), neural networks (middle right), and two variants of random forest (bottom row). In each method, only the distance of the drawn points is used as a dependency.\n\n\nEach interpolation method was applied using the “default” settings. Tuning could possibly lead to significant changes in all of them. Fascinatingly, the error measures correlate to the visual results: Kriging and the neural network show the best performance, followed by the random forest models and the support-vector machine.\n\n\n\nmodel\ntotal_error\nmean_error\nsd_error\n\n\n\n\nKriging\n15797773.0\n54.2\n67.9\n\n\nNeural Network\n19772241.0\n67.8\n80.5\n\n\nRandom Forest\n20540628.1\n70.4\n82.5\n\n\nNormalized Random Forest\n20597969.8\n70.6\n82.7\n\n\nSupport Vector Machine\n21152987.7\n72.5\n68.3\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional references\nGet the Most Out of AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning Part 1 (10:52) and Part 2 (13:18)\nWhy You Should NOT Learn Machine Learning!

These results are often linked to biophysical, geophysical or anthropogenic processes in order to gain both a deeper understanding and the possibility of developing predictive models. Methods of image analysis are of outstanding importance for generating spatial information from the underlying processes. Since both the quantity and quality of this “image data” are playing an increasingly important role in environmental monitoring and modeling, it is becoming more and more necessary to integrate “big data” concepts into the analyses. This means performing reproducible analyses with large amounts of data (&gt;&gt; 1 TB). This is essential for both scientific knowledge gain and future societal challenges.\nAs already explained in the introduction, we start with a scalable change detection analysis of forest damage in low mountain ranges, which is a typical application-oriented task. Scalable means that we limit the analysis to a manageable area, the Nordwestharz, and to two time slices. However, the resulting algorithm can be applied to different or larger areas and to more time slices.",

While our eyes can interpret a true-color image relatively conclusively and intuitively, a reliable and reproducible, i.e. scientifically sound, interpretation requires other approaches.

Probably the best known and most widely used approach is the supervised classification of image data into categories of interest.\nIn this unit, you will learn about the classification of satellite image data.

The focus is then on model building and quality assessment, which can be seen as the technical basis for classification, in order to finally derive the interpretation of the results in terms of content in the data post-processing.\nWe will go through this process step by step.\n\nUnsupervised Classification - k-means clustering\nProbably the best-known unsupervised classification technique is K-means clustering, which is also referred to as the “simplest machine learning algorithm”.\nK-means clustering is a technique commonly used in satellite image classification to group pixels with similar spectral characteristics. Treating each pixel as an observation, the algorithm assigns pixels to clusters based on their spectral values, with each cluster having a mean (or centroid) that represents its central spectral signature. This results in the segmentation of the image into distinct regions (similar to Voronoi cells) corresponding to land cover types, such as water, vegetation or urban areas, facilitating further analysis. It is often used to obtain an initial overview of whether the raster data can be sufficiently separated in feature space.\n\nFigure: Convergence of k-means clustering from an unfavorable starting position (two initial cluster centers are fairly close). Chire [CC BY-SA 4.0] via wikipedia.org\n\n\nSupervised classification\nIn supervised land cover classification, a model is derived from a limited amount of training land cover data that predicts land cover for the entire data set. The land cover types are defined a priori, and the model attempts to predict these types based on the similarity between the characteristics of the training data and the rest of the data set.\n Classifiers (e.g. the maximum likelihood classifier) or machine learning algorithms (such as Random Forest) use the training data to determine descriptive models that represent statistical signatures, classification trees or other functions. Within the limits of the quality of the training data, such models are suitable and representative for making predictions for areas if the predictors from the model are available for the entire area.\nWe now want to predict the spatial characteristics of clear-felling/no forest using a maximum likelihood classification and random forest, and apply standard methods of random validation and model quality assessment.\nThe goal is to separate clearcuts from all other pixels and to quantify the differences between 2018 and 2022.\n\nMaximum Likelihood Classification\nMaximum likelihood classification assumes that the distribution of data for each class and in each channel is normally distributed. Under this assumption, the probability that a particular pixel belongs to a particular class is calculated. Since the probabilities can also be specified as a threshold, without this restriction, all pixels are assigned regardless of how unlikely they are. Each pixel is assigned to the class that has the highest probability (i.e., the maximum probability).\n\n\n\nRandom forest\nRandom forests can be used for both regression and classification tasks, with the latter being particularly relevant in environmental remote sensing. Like any machine learning method, the random forest model learns to recognize patterns and structures in the data itself. Since the random forest algorithm also requires training data, it is also a supervised learning method. !\nFigure: Simplified illustration of data classification by random forest during training. Venkata Jagannath [CC BY-SA 4.0] via wikipedia.org\nA random forest algorithm learns from the data by creating random decision trees – hence the name. For classification tasks, the algorithm takes a suitable instance of a decision tree from the training data set and assigns the corresponding class to the pixel. This is repeated with all available decision trees. Finally, the pixel is assigned to the class that has the most trees, according to the winner-takes-all principle.\nFrom a pragmatic point of view, classification tasks generally require the following steps:\n\nCreation of a comprehensive input data set that contains one or more raster layers.\nSelection of training areas, i.e. subsets of the input data set for which the land cover type is known to the remote sensing expert. Knowledge of the land cover can be obtained, for example, from one’s own or third-party in situ observations, management information or other remote sensing products (e.g. high-resolution aerial photographs).\nTraining a model using the training sites. For validation purposes, the training sites are often subdivided into one or more test and training sites to evaluate the performance of the model algorithm.\nApplying the trained model to the entire data set, i.e. predicting the land cover type based on the similarity of the data at each site to the class characteristics of the training data set.",

    "text": "Change detection case study: Harz Mountains\nSince 2018, there has been a notable increase in the incidence of extensive forest dieback in the Harz Mountains. During this period, the combination of repeated years of drought, extreme heat waves and the resulting weakening of the spruce trees led to an exponential increase in the population of bark beetles. The combined impact of these factors resulted in the extensive mortality of spruce stands across an area of approximately 30,000 hectares over a period of approximately five to six years. This equates to approximately 35% of the total forest area of the Harz.\nIt is important to note that the prolonged drought in 2018, 2019 and 2020, which is considered one of the most severe in the region, has significantly exacerbated the damage in the Harz Mountains.\nIn this context, a time series analysis or a change detection analysis is an essential technique for quantifying and localising the damage and characterising its dynamics.\n\nSetting up the work environment\nHowever, the work environment is usually loaded first.\n\n# ---- 0 Projekt Setup ----\nrequire(\"pacman\")\n#remotes::install_github(\"zivankaraman/CDSE\")\n# packages installing if necessary and loading\npacman::p_load(mapview, mapedit, tmap, tmaptools, raster, terra, stars, gdalcubes, sf,webshot, dplyr,CDSE,webshot, downloader, tidyverse,RStoolbox,rprojroot, exactextractr, randomForest, ranger, e1071, caret, link2GI, rstac, OpenStreetMap,colorspace,ows4R,httr)\n#--- Switch to determine whether digitization is required.

However, it creates more clarity for the later process to already have the data needed in different projections.\n\n\n# download the Harz region from the UBA WFS server\n# nre_regions &lt;- \"https://geodienste.bfn.de/ogc/wfs/gliederungen?\"\n# regions_client &lt;- WFSClient$new(nre_regions, \n#                             serviceVersion = \"2.0.0\",)\n# regions_client$getFeatureTypes(pretty = TRUE)\n# \n# url &lt;- parse_url(nre_regions)\n# url$query &lt;- list(service = \"wfs\",\n#                   #version = \"2.0.0\", # optional\n#                   request = \"GetFeature\",\n#                   typename = \"Haupteinheiten\",\n#                   srsName = \"EPSG:4326\"\n#                   )\n# request &lt;- build_url(url)\n# \n# nre_regions_sf &lt;- read_sf(request)\n# harz = nre_regions_sf |&gt; \n#   filter(NAME_ORD3 %in% c( \"Oberharz\")) \n# plot(harz)\n# harz_bbox = bb(harz,projection=4326)\n# harz_32632 =sf::st_transform(harz,crs = 32632)\n# harz_bbox_32632 = bb(harz_32632,projection=32632)\n\n# Download training data which is also used for the extend\nutils::download.file(url=\"https://github.com/gisma/gismaData/raw/master/geoinfo/train_areas_2019_2020.gpkg\",destfile=file.path(\"../data/train_areas_2019_2020.gpkg\"))\ntrain_areas_2019_2020 = st_read(file.path(\"../data/train_areas_2019_2020.gpkg\"))\n\nReading layer `train_areas_2019_2020' from data source \n  `/home/creu/edu/gisma-courses/LV-19-d19-006-24/data/train_areas_2019_2020.gpkg' \n  using driver `GPKG'\nSimple feature collection with 87 features and 3 fields\nGeometry type: POLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 10.21106 ymin: 51.84931 xmax: 10.39679 ymax: 51.94446\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\ntrain_areas_2019_2020  |&gt;\n  st_bbox() -&gt; bbox\n\n# mapping the extents and boundaries of the choosen geometries\n# tmap_mode(\"view\")\n# tmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE) + \n#   tm_basemap(server = c(\"Esri.WorldGrayCanvas\", \"OpenStreetMap\", \"Esri.WorldTopoMap\",\"Esri.WorldImagery\")) +\n#   #tm_shape(harz) +   \n#   tm_polygons(alpha = 0.4)\n\n#--- Reading the data from the directories\n\n##--- This describes how to process the Corine land use and land cover dataset\n## The necessary file can also be downloaded from the repository\n## An account is required for the download https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/corine-land-cover\n## Therefore, download the data manually and unzip \n## U2018_CLC2018_V2020_20u1.tif into the data directory \n## Then continue\nif (!file.exists(file.path(root_folder,\"data/corine_harz.tif\"))){\n  corine = rast(file.path(\"../data/U2018_CLC2018_V2020_20u1.tif\"))\n  corine = terra::project(corine,\"EPSG:4326\" )\n  corine_harz = terra::crop(corine,vect(train_areas_2019_2020))\n  terra::writeRaster(corine_harz,file.path(root_folder,\"data/corine_harz.tif\"),overwrite=TRUE)\n  }\ncorine_harz = rast(file.path(root_folder,\"data/corine_harz.tif\"))\n# Create a forest mask from corine\n# Agro-forestry areas code=22, Broad-leaved forest code=23,\n# Coniferous forest code=24, Mixed forest code=25\nm &lt;- c(-100, 22, 0,\n       22, 26, 1,\n       26, 500, 0)\nrclmat &lt;- matrix(m, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)\nharz_forest_mask &lt;- classify(corine_harz, rclmat, include.lowest=TRUE)\n\n\nmapview(corine_harz)+mapview(train_areas_2019_2020,zcol=\"class\")+harz_forest_mask\n\n\n\n\n# create extents\ne &lt;- ext(harz_forest_mask)\np &lt;- as.polygons(e, crs=\"EPSG:4326\")\ncm=sf::st_as_sf(p)\nharz_bbox = bb(train_areas_2019_2020,projection=4326)",

    "text": "Step 1: Retrieving Sentinel data\nSentinel-2 is currently the most important platform for Earth observation in all areas, but especially for climate change, land use and ecological issues at all levels, from the upper micro to the global scale.\nThere are two operational Sentinel-2 satellites: Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, both in sun-synchronous polar orbits and 180 degrees out of phase. This arrangement allows them to cover the mid-latitudes with an orbital period of about 5 days.\nThe Sentinel-2 data are therefore predestined to record spatial and temporal changes on the Earth’s surface (the forest was green in early summer, it has disappeared by late summer). They are ideal for timely studies before and after natural disasters, or for biomass balancing, etc.\n\nAternative 1: Using gdalcubes\nThe gdalcubes tool has been developed with the objective of facilitating the processing of extensive collections of satellite images. It has been designed to enhance the efficiency, speed, intuitiveness and interactivity of this task.\n\nCloud-Optimised GeoTIFFs (COGs)\nUnfortunately, the official Sentinel-2 archives are anything but user-friendly. Technically, the processed product levels are available for download pre-processed as L1C and L2A products in JP2K format. The preferred file format is JP2K, which is storage efficient but has to be downloaded in its entirety locally by the user, resulting in high access costs and huge local storage requirements. The cloud-optimised GeoTIFFs (COGs) allow only the areas of interest to be downloaded and are also much faster to process. However, this requires optimised cloud services and a technically different access logic than in the traditional processing chains used so far.\n\n\nSpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC)\nThe [Spatial-Temporal Asset Catalogue] (https://stacspec.org/) (STAC) provides a common language for simplified indexing and discovery of geospatial data. A “Spatio-Temporal Asset” is a file that contains information in a specific space and time.\nThis approach allows any provider of spatio-temporal data (imagery, SAR, point clouds, data cubes, full motion video, etc.) to provide Spatio-Temporal Asset Catalogues (STAC) for their data. STAC focuses on an easy-to-implement standard that organisations can use to make their data available in a durable and reliable way.\nElement84 has provided a public API called Earth-search, a central search catalogue for all public AWS datasets using STAC (including the new Sentinel-2 COGs), which contains more than 11.4 million Sentinel-2 scenes worldwide as of 1 November 2017.\nOne major challenge is the fact that most of the earth surface related remote sensing activities are heavily “disturbed” by the atmosphere, especially by clouds. So to find cloud free satellite imagery is a common and cumbersome task. This task is supported by the rstac package which provides a convenient tool to find and filter adequate Sentinel-2 images out of the COG data storage. However, to address the AOI we need to provide the extend via the bbox argument of the corresponding function stac_search(). So first we need to derive and transform the required bounding box to WGS84 geo-coordinates, easily done with the sf functions st_bbox() and st_transform(). In addition we adapt the projection of the referencing vector objects to all other later projection needs.\n\n\nQuerying images with rstac\nUsing the rstac package, we first request all available images from 2018 to 208 that intersect with our region of interest. Here, since the polygon has WGS84 as CRS, we do not need to transform the bounding box before using the stac_search() function.\n\n# search the data stack for the given period and area\ns = stac(\"https://earth-search.aws.element84.com/v0\")\n\n\nitems &lt;- s |&gt;\n  stac_search(collections = \"sentinel-s2-l2a-cogs\",\n              bbox= c(bbox[\"xmin\"],bbox[\"ymin\"],bbox[\"xmax\"],bbox[\"ymax\"]), , \n              datetime = c(\"2018-06-01/2022-09-01\"),\n              limit = 600) |&gt;\n  post_request() \nitems\n\n###Items\n- matched feature(s): 626\n- features (600 item(s) / 26 not fetched):\n  - S2A_32UNC_20220901_0_L2A\n  - S2A_32UNC_20220829_0_L2A\n  - S2B_32UNC_20220827_0_L2A\n  - S2B_32UNC_20220824_0_L2A\n  - S2A_32UNC_20220822_0_L2A\n  - S2A_32UNC_20220819_1_L2A\n  - S2B_32UNC_20220817_0_L2A\n  - S2B_32UNC_20220814_0_L2A\n  - S2A_32UNC_20220812_0_L2A\n  - S2A_32UNC_20220809_0_L2A\n  - ... with 590 more feature(s).\n- assets: \nAOT, B01, B02, B03, B04, B05, B06, B07, B08, B09, B11, B12, B8A, info, metadata, overview, SCL, thumbnail, visual, WVP\n- item's fields: \nassets, bbox, collection, geometry, id, links, properties, properties.sentinel:boa_offset_applied, stac_extensions, stac_version, type\n\n\nThis gives us 334 matching images recorded between 2019-06-01 and 2021-09-01.\n\n\nCreating a monthly Sentinel-2 data cube\nTo obtain a Sentinel data cube, a gdalcube image collection must be created from the STAC query result. To do this, the asset names must be explicitly named in order to apply the SCL channel with the quality characteristics per pixel (classification as clouds, cloud shadows, etc.). In this query, a filter is set to cloud cover &lt;= 50%.\n\ns2_collection &lt;- stac_image_collection(items$features,\n                                      asset_names = \nc(\"B01\",\"B02\",\"B03\",\"B04\",\"B05\",\"B06\", \"B07\",\"B08\",\"B8A\",\"B09\",\"B11\",\"SCL\"), \n                                      property_filter = function(x) {x[[\"eo:cloud_cover\"]] &lt; 5}) \ns2_collection\n\nImage collection object, referencing 78 images with 12 bands\nImages:\n                      name     left      top   bottom    right\n1 S2B_32UNC_20220824_0_L2A 9.494450 52.34699 51.35264 10.61137\n2 S2A_32UNC_20220812_0_L2A 8.999721 52.35046 51.35264 10.61137\n3 S2A_32UNC_20220623_0_L2A 8.999721 52.35046 51.35264 10.61137\n4 S2B_32UNC_20220618_0_L2A 8.999721 52.35046 51.35264 10.61137\n5 S2B_32UNC_20220615_0_L2A 9.471038 52.34716 51.35264 10.61137\n6 S2B_32UNC_20220519_1_L2A 8.999721 52.35046 51.35264 10.61137\n             datetime        srs\n1 2022-08-24T10:26:32 EPSG:32632\n2 2022-08-12T10:36:42 EPSG:32632\n3 2022-06-23T10:36:42 EPSG:32632\n4 2022-06-18T10:36:34 EPSG:32632\n5 2022-06-15T10:26:36 EPSG:32632\n6 2022-05-19T10:36:29 EPSG:32632\n[ omitted 72 images ] \n\nBands:\n   name offset scale unit nodata image_count\n1   B01      0     1                      78\n2   B02      0     1                      78\n3   B03      0     1                      78\n4   B04      0     1                      78\n5   B05      0     1                      78\n6   B06      0     1                      78\n7   B07      0     1                      78\n8   B08      0     1                      78\n9   B09      0     1                      78\n10  B11      0     1                      78\n11  B8A      0     1                      78\n12  SCL      0     1                      78\n\n\nThe result is 118 images, i.e. approx. 1.8 images per month, from which we can now create a data cube. To do this, we use the UTM bounding box of our polygon as a spatial boundary, a spatial resolution of 10 metres, a bilinear spatial interpolation (useful for the spatially lower-resolution sentinel channels) and calculate monthly median values for all pixel values from the available images of a month. In addition, we add a buffer (b) on each side of the cube.\nThe gdalcube image collection can be considered as a proxy structure object which will be applied on the COGs.\n\nst_as_sfc(bbox) |&gt;\n  st_transform(\"EPSG:32632\") |&gt;\n  st_bbox() -&gt; bbox_utm\nv = cube_view(srs = \"EPSG:32632\", extent = list(t0 = \"2018-06\", t1 = \"2022-09\", left = bbox_utm[\"xmin\"] - 10, right = bbox_utm[\"xmax\"] + 10, bottom = bbox_utm[\"ymin\"] - 10, top = bbox_utm[\"ymax\"] + 10),\n              dx = 10, dy = 10, dt = \"P1M\", aggregation = \"median\", resampling = \"bilinear\")\n\nv\n\nA data cube view object\n\nDimensions:\n               low             high count pixel_size\nt       2018-06-01       2022-09-30    52        P1M\ny  5744956.9172092  5755796.9172092  1084         10\nx 583230.473549458 596220.473549458  1299         10\n\nSRS: \"EPSG:32632\"\nTemporal aggregation method: \"median\"\nSpatial resampling method: \"bilinear\"\n\n\nNext we create a data cube, subset the red and near infrared bands and crop by our polygon, which simply sets pixel values outside the polygon to NA. We then save the data cube as a single netCDF file. Note that this is not necessary, but saving intermediate results sometimes makes debugging easier, especially if the methods applied afterwards are computationally intensive.\nOnly calling a final action will start the processing on the COG-Server.

The cluster algorithm can achieve a fairly acceptable separation of the clearings/bald spots with 5 clusters, which makes a classification seem promising. Also experiment with other cluster settings and discuss the results.\n\n## k-means über RStoolbox\n\n#\"EVI\"   \"kNDVI\" \"SAVI\"\nprediction_kmeans_2018 = RStoolbox::unsuperClass(pred_stack_2018, \n                                                 nClasses = 5,\n                                                 norm = TRUE, \n                                                 algorithm = \"MacQueen\")\n# Klassifikation\nplot(prediction_kmeans_2018$map)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprediction_kmeans_2022 = RStoolbox::unsuperClass(pred_stack_2022, \n                                                 nClasses = 5,norm = TRUE, \n                                                 algorithm = \"MacQueen\")\nplot(prediction_kmeans_2022$map)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbfast: Spatial identification of magnitudes and time periods of kNDVI changes\nTo apply a more complex time series method such as Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST), which is often used for land cover changes (e.g. (Wu et al. 2020)), the bfastmonitor() function in gdalcubes can be used, the data cube operations below allow you to provide custom user-defined R functions instead of string expressions that translate to built-in reducers.\nIn our example, bfastmonitor returns change date and change magnitude values per time series so we can use reduce_time(). The script below: 1. calculates the kNDVI, 1. applies bfastmonitor(), and properly handles errors e.g. due to missing data with tryCatch(), and 1. finally writes out the resulting change dates and magnitudes of change for all pixels of the time series as a netCDF file.\nThe results shows the changes starting at 7/2019 until 10/2021.\n\ngdalcubes_options(parallel = 16)\n\nncdf_cube(file.path(root_folder,\"..data/harz_2018_2022_all.nc\")) |&gt;\n  reduce_time(names = c(\"change_date\", \"change_magnitude\"), FUN = function(x) {\n    knr &lt;- exp(-((x[\"B08\",]/10000)-(x[\"B04\",]/10000))^2/(2))\n    kndvi &lt;- (1-knr) / (1+knr)    \n    if (all(is.na(kndvi))) {\n      return(c(NA,NA))\n    }\n    kndvi_ts = ts(kndvi, start = c(2018, 1), frequency = 12)\n    library(bfast)\n    tryCatch({\n        result = bfastmonitor(kndvi_ts, start = c(2019,1), level = 0.01)\n        return(c(result$breakpoint, result$magnitude))\n      }, error = function(x) {\n        return(c(NA,NA))\n      })\n  }) |&gt;\n  write_ncdf(file.path(root_folder,\"data/bfast_results.nc\"), overwrite = TRUE)\n\nNow we can use the netCDF file and map the results with any preferred visualisation tool.

This data is referred to as training data and is very often obtained by manual digitization. This can be done quite comfortably in RStudio if only a few training areas have to be digitized quickly and effectively.\nWe assume that we want to classify two types of land cover: clearcut and other.\nFor larger tasks, it makes sense to use the convenient method described in the current QGIS documentation, for example in the digitizing tutorial.\nDigitizing training data in R\nAssuming we

    "text": "Step 4 - supervised classification\nClassifiers (e.g. the maximum likelihood classifier) or machine learning algorithms (such as Random Forest) use the training data to determine descriptive models that represent statistical signatures, classification trees or other functions. Within the limits of the quality of the training data, such models are suitable and representative for making predictions for areas if the predictors from the model are available for the entire area.\nWe now want to predict the spatial characteristics of clear-felling/no forest using a maximum likelihood classification and random forest, and apply standard methods of random validation and model quality assessment.\nThe goal is to separate clearcuts from all other pixels and to quantify the differences between 2019 and 2020.\n\nMaximum Likelihood Classification\nSince the maximum likelihood algorithm requires training data, it is a supervised learning method. This means that we, as users, have to provide the algorithm with data that conveys knowledge about the classes to be predicted. This data is then divided into training and test data.\n\n# ---- Maximum Likelihood Classification ----\n\n## Here the caret utility package is used\n# Setting a \"seed\" enables reproducible randomness\nset.seed(123)\ntDF = readRDS( file.path(root_folder,\"data/tDF_2018_2022.rds\"))\n# Randomly draw 15% of the data (training/test)\nidx = createDataPartition(tDF$class,list = FALSE,p = 0.05)\ntrainDat = tDF[idx,]\ntestDat = tDF[-idx,]\n\n# Response variable (= \"class\" column) must be of the \"factor\" data type\ntrainDat$class &lt;- as.factor(trainDat$class)\ntestDat$class &lt;- as.factor(testDat$class)\n\n\n# superClass() function from the RSToolbox package requires the table to be converted into the\n# required (old) SpatialdataPoint object\n\nsp_trainDat = trainDat\nsp_testDat = testDat \nsp::coordinates(sp_trainDat) = ~x+y\nsp::coordinates(sp_testDat) = ~x+y\ncrs(sp_trainDat) = crs(pred_stack_2018)\ncrs(sp_testDat) = crs(pred_stack_2018)\n\n\n# superClass method \"mlc\" trains the model and then classifies it\nprediction_mlc_2018 &lt;- superClass(pred_stack_2018, trainData = sp_trainDat[,1:16],valData = sp_testDat[,1:16], responseCol = \"class\", model = \"mlc\", tuneLength = 1, trainPartition = 0.3,verbose = TRUE, filename=file.path(root_folder,\"data/prediction_mlc_2018.tif\"))\n\nMaximum Likelihood Classification \n\n3490 samples\n  15 predictor\n   2 classes: 'clearcut', 'other' \n\nNo pre-processing\nResampling: Cross-Validated (5 fold) \nSummary of sample sizes: 2793, 2792, 2792, 2791, 2792 \nResampling results:\n\n  Accuracy   Kappa    \n  0.8999987  0.3932103\n\n[[1]]\n  TrainAccuracy TrainKappa method\n1     0.8999987  0.3932103 custom\n\n[[2]]\nCross-Validated (5 fold) Confusion Matrix \n\n(entries are average cell counts across resamples)\n \n          Reference\nPrediction clearcut other\n  clearcut     26.2  68.6\n  other         1.2 602.0\n                         \n Accuracy (average) : 0.9\n\n\nConfusion Matrix and Statistics\n\n          Reference\nPrediction clearcut other\n  clearcut     1265  2538\n  other          63 23130\n                                          \n               Accuracy : 0.9037          \n                 95% CI : (0.9001, 0.9071)\n    No Information Rate : 0.9508          \n    P-Value [Acc &gt;

In remote sensing, this is usually called classification.\n\nrf_model = readRDS(file.path(root_folder,\"data/rf_model.rds\"))\n\n# Classification (also known as prediction)\nprediction_rf_2018  = terra::predict(pred_stack_2018 ,rf_model)\nprediction_rf_2022  = terra::predict(pred_stack_2022 ,rf_model)\nsaveRDS(prediction_rf_2018, file.path(root_folder,\"data/prediction_rf_2018.rds\"))\nsaveRDS(prediction_rf_2022, file.path(root_folder,\"data/prediction_rf_2022.rds\"))\n\n\n## ##\nprediction_rf_2018 = readRDS(file.path(root_folder,\"data/prediction_rf_2018.rds\"))\nprediction_rf_2022 = readRDS(file.path(root_folder,\"data/prediction_rf_2022.rds\"))\nprediction_mlc_2018 = rast(file.path(root_folder,\"data/prediction_mlc_2018.tif\"))\nprediction_mlc_2022 = rast(file.path(root_folder,\"data/prediction_mlc_2022.tif\"))\n\n## ---- Visualisierung mit mapview ----\nmask = resample(harz_forest_mask,pred_stack_2022)\n\nplot(mask*prediction_rf_2022 - mask*prediction_rf_2018) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(mask*prediction_mlc_2022-mask*prediction_mlc_2018)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA visual comparison shows that the Random Forest and Maximum Likelihood classifications provide results of comparable quality. But does this impression stand up to quantitative analysis?\n\n\nStep 5: Estimation model quality\nThe test data are now used for the independent quality check of the model. A confusion matrix indicates how accurately the model predicts the correct classes. The main diagonal of the matrix indicates the cases in which the model applies. In our classification of only two classes, however, a special case applies: evaluation of a binary classifier. Detailed explanations for the function used here can be found in the caret help.\nThe main statements about model quality are:\n\n‘Positive’ Class = clearcut: is measured with the sensitivity (true positive rate), which indicates the probability that a positive object is correctly classified as positive.\n‘Negative Class’ = other: is measured with the specificity (true negative rate) and indicates the probability that a negative object is correctly classified as negative.\nPositive and negative predictive values indicate the actual performance for clearcut and other. They are corrected for the actual frequency distribution and are a measure of the precision and performance of the model with regard to the respective classes.\n\nDespite the high values, we see that the clearcut class drops off significantly here. This can certainly be taken as an indication of the need to improve the classification.\nOverall, however, the model can be considered good.\n\n## ##\n# ----Calculation of the confusion matrix  ----\ncm_rf &lt;- confusionMatrix(data = predict(rf_model, newdata = testDat), testDat$class)\ncm_rf\n\nConfusion Matrix and Statistics\n\n          Reference\nPrediction clearcut other\n  clearcut     1396   319\n  other        1204 63469\n                                          \n               Accuracy : 0.9771          \n                 95% CI : (0.9759, 0.9782)\n    No Information Rate : 0.9608          \n    P-Value [Acc &gt; NIR] : &lt; 2.2e-16       \n                                          \n                  Kappa : 0.6357          \n                                          \n Mcnemar's Test P-Value : &lt; 2.2e-16       \n                                          \n            Sensitivity : 0.53692         \n            Specificity : 0.99500         \n         Pos Pred Value : 0.81399         \n         Neg Pred Value : 0.98138         \n             Prevalence : 0.03916         \n         Detection Rate : 0.02103         \n   Detection Prevalence : 0.02583         \n      Balanced Accuracy : 0.76596         \n                                          \n       'Positive' Class : clearcut",

On the one hand, the conventional approach of downloading individual data sets and processing them locally, and on the other hand, an introduction to cloud computing, which mainly takes place on the corresponding servers. We have refrained from calculating exclusively on the servers, but technically this is identical. This is didactically questionable, but it shows the direction in which the processing and analysis of mass data is currently moving. The use of cloud-based techniques is essential, especially for long time series and valid systematic data-driven analyses.For further information, please refer to gdalcubes tutorials and (not mentioned in this reader) openeo and the R-interface to openeo.",

The privacy policy applies to all processing of personal data carried out by us, both in the context of the provision of our services and in particular on our websites, in mobile applications and within external online presences, such as our social media profiles (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Online Offerings”).\n\n\nThe terms used are not gender-specific.\n\n\nResponsible\n\n\nDr Christoph ReudenbachDeutschhaustr 1035037 Marburg\n\n\nEmail address: reudenbach@uni-marburg.de.\n\n\nImprint: https://www.uni-marburg.de/de/impressum.\n\n\nOverview of Processing\n\n\nThe following overview summarizes the types of data processed and the purposes of their processing, and refers to the data subjects.\n\n\nTypes of Data Processed\n\n\n\nContent data (e.g. input in online forms).\n\n\nContact data (e.g. email, phone numbers).\n\n\nMeta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).\n\n\nUse data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times).\n\n\n\nCategories of data subjects\n\n\n\nCommunication partners.\n\n\nUsers (e.g.. Website visitors, users of online services).\n\n\n\nPurposes of processing\n\n\n\nDirect marketing (e.g., by email or postal mail).\n\n\nContact requests and communications.\n\n\n\nRelevant legal basis\n\n\nThe following is an overview of the legal basis of the GDPR on the basis of which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or domicile. Furthermore, should more specific legal bases be decisive in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the data protection declaration.\n\n \n\n\nConsent (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a. DSGVO) - The data subject has given his or her consent to the processing of personal data concerning him or her for a specific purpose or purposes.\n\n\nRegistered interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f. DSGVO) - Processing is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, unless such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require the protection of personal data.\n\n\n\nNational data protection regulations in Germany: In addition to the data protection regulations of the General Data Protection Regulation, national regulations on data protection apply in Germany. These include, in particular, the Act on Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing (Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special regulations on the right to information, the right to erasure, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission, as well as automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling. Furthermore, it regulates data processing for employment purposes (Section 26 BDSG), in particular with regard to the establishment, implementation or termination of employment relationships as well as the consent of employees. Furthermore, state data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.\n\n \n\nSecurity measures\n\n\nWe take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the processing, as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.\n\n.\n\nMeasures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to data as well as access to, entry into, disclosure of, assurance of availability of, and segregation of data concerning them. Furthermore, we have established procedures to ensure the exercise of data subjects’ rights, the deletion of data, and responses to data compromise. Furthermore, we take the protection of personal data into account as early as the development or selection of hardware, software as well as procedures in accordance with the principle of data protection, through technology design and through data protection-friendly default settings.\n\n \n\nDeletion of data\n\n\nThe data processed by us will be deleted in accordance with legal requirements as soon as their consents permitted for processing are revoked or other permissions cease to apply (e.g. if the purpose of processing this data has ceased to apply or it is not necessary for the purpose).\n\n \n\nIf the data are not deleted because they are required for other and legally permissible purposes, their processing will be limited to these purposes. That is, the data will be blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be retained for reasons of commercial or tax law or whose storage is necessary for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural person or legal entity.\n\n \n\nOur privacy notices may also include further information on the retention and deletion of data that takes precedence for the processing operations in question.\n\n \n\nUse of cookies\n\n\nCookies are text files that contain data from websites or domains visited and are stored by a browser on the user’s computer. The primary purpose of a cookie is to store information about a user during or after their visit within an online site. Stored information may include, for example, language settings on a website, login status, a shopping cart, or where a video was watched. We further include in the term cookies other technologies that perform the same functions as cookies (e.g., when user details are stored using pseudonymous online identifiers, also referred to as “user IDs”)\n\n.\n\nThe following cookie types and functions are distinguished:\n\n\n\nTemporary cookies (also: session or session cookies): Temporary cookies are deleted at the latest after a user has left an online offer and closed his browser.\n\n\nPermanent cookies: Permanent cookies remain stored even after closing the browser. For example, the login status can be saved or preferred content can be displayed directly when the user revisits a website. Likewise, the interests of users used for range measurement or marketing purposes can be stored in such a cookie.\n\n\nFirst-party cookies: First-party cookies are set by ourselves.\n\n\nThird-party cookies (also: third-party cookies): Third-party cookies are mainly used by advertisers (so-called third parties) to process user information.\n\n\nNecessary (also: essential or absolutely necessary) cookies: Cookies may be absolutely necessary for the operation of a website (e.g. to store logins or other user input or for security reasons).\n\n\nStatistics, marketing and personalization cookies: Furthermore, cookies are usually also used in the context of range measurement and when the interests of a user or his behavior (e.g. viewing certain content, use of functions, etc.) on individual web pages are stored in a user profile. Such profiles are used, for example, to show users content that matches their potential interests. This process is also referred to as “tracking”, i.e., tracking the potential interests of users. Insofar as we use cookies or “tracking” technologies, we will inform you separately in our privacy policy or in the context of obtaining consent.\n\n\n\nNotes on legal bases: On which legal basis we process your personal data using cookies depends on whether we ask you for consent. If this is the case and you consent to the use of cookies, the legal basis for the processing of your data is the declared consent. Otherwise, the data processed with the help of cookies is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. in a business operation of our online offer and its improvement) or, if the use of cookies is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations.\n\n.\n\nDuration of storage: If we do not provide you with explicit information about the storage period of permanent cookies (e.g. in the context of a so-called cookie opt-in), please assume that the storage period can be up to two years.\n\n.\n\nGeneral information on revocation and objection (opt-out):  Depending on whether the processing is based on consent or legal permission, you have the option at any time to revoke any consent given or to object to the processing of your data by cookie technologies (collectively referred to as “opt-out”). You can initially declare your objection by means of your browser settings, e.g. by deactivating the use of cookies (whereby this may also restrict the functionality of our online offer). An objection to the use of cookies for online marketing purposes can also be declared by means of a variety of services, especially in the case of tracking, via the websites https://optout.aboutads.info and https://www.youronlinechoices.com/. In addition, you can receive further objection notices in the context of the information on the service providers and cookies used.\n\n.\n\nProcessing of cookie data on the basis of consent: We use a cookie consent management procedure, in the context of which the consent of users to the use of cookies, or the processing and providers mentioned in the cookie consent management procedure can be obtained and managed and revoked by users. Here, the declaration of consent is stored in order not to have to repeat its query and to be able to prove the consent in accordance with the legal obligation.

    "text": "One could claim that the fact living on the surface of the earth and only get to know a small space through direct personal experience is the most important motivation for most of the geographic work. Compensation for this lack of direct experience has been and is being made, especially in scientific geography, with the help of efficient spatio-temporal techniques of abstraction.\nKnowledge of spatial and/or temporal aspects of our environment is increasingly in demand for action-relevant relationships. Whether we ask as tourists, consumers, producers or planners spatial information, or even knowledge.\nGeographic Information Science (GIS) is based on versatile and powerful software tools that are used in modeling, analysis, data mining merging and numerous other spatio-temporal applications. Nevertheless the most powerful tool is our mind developing the concepts and developing the necessary algorithms.\n\nIntended learning outcomes\nAt the end of this course you should be able\n\nto understand, adapt and develop geographic information science methods\nto design workflows suitable to solve common spatio temporal data-related issues\nto deploy your workflows using geo-information science tools, R scripts and collaborative code management platforms for task management and issue tracking\nto critically evaluate your spatio-temporal analysis\nto communicate your workflow and analysis results\n\n\n\nCourse features\nThe course is intended as a blended learning module in our study program although the provided introductions, explanations and examples might be useful for self-study, too.\n\n\nDeliverables\nThe graded course certificate will be based on a team portfolio hosted as a team repository on GitHub. The individual portfolio items are defined in the respective course assignments along with the information if they will be marked or not. Marked portfolio items encompass the presentation and peer-review the paper which inform about the results of two problem solving assignments related to the computation and analysis of the geographic information systems products.\n\n\nPreparation and prerequisites\nThe courses assumes basic knowledge and skills in remote sensing and GIS."

Preferable at on a clearing to reduce impacts of falling branches or similar.  2.) One square meter around the box must be cleared of any vegetation and the A-horizon (depending on the slope, even more).\n 3.) Around this area a further strip with a diameter of at least 1 meter must also be cleared of organic material, especially leaves. Dig up the A-horizon and exclude roots and organic stuff. Note that the wiring sections must also be cleared of combustible organic material.\n 4.) Check cables and screws for proper seating and integrity.\n\n5.) Check proper installation of the solar panel. Mount the panel on a simple wooden slat attached to the frame to avoid damage to the protective foil on the back. Such damage will destroy the panel.\n\n6.) Attach the solar connectors to the panel. This avoids ground contact and provides good weather protection. This can be done very easily by threading cable ties through the plugs and the junction box. {% include figure image_path=“../images/battery_box/07_solar_plugs.jpg” alt=“Attach the solar connectors to the panel.” %}  7.) Finally, the box should be secured against unauthorized or accidental opening. For this purpose there is a steel cable with a number lock, which is to be attached in the way it is placed there."

The preferred file format is JP2K, which is storage efficient but has to be downloaded in its entirety locally by the user, resulting in high access costs and huge local storage requirements. The cloud-optimised GeoTIFFs (COGs) allow only the areas of interest to be downloaded and are also much faster to process.

So to find cloud free satellite imagery is a common and cumbersome task. This task is supported by the rstac package which provides a convenient tool to find and filter adequate Sentinel-2 images out of the COG data storage. However, to address the AOI we need to provide the extend via the bbox argument of the corresponding function stac_search(). So first we need to derive and transform the required bounding box to WGS84 geo-coordinates, easily done with the sf functions st_bbox() and st_transform(). In addition we adapt the projection of the referencing vector objects to all other later projection needs.\n::::: boxSuccess \n\nPlease note to project to three different CRS is for this examples convenience and clarity and somewhat superfluous. Only the corner coordinates of the sections are required and not the complete geometries. However, it creates more clarity for the later process to already have the data needed in different projections."

The reducer function is executed in a new R process without access to the current workspace. It is not possible to access variables defined outside of the function and packages must be loaded within the function. 2. The reducer function must always return a vector with the same length (for all time series). 3. It is a good idea to think about NA values, i.e. you should check whether the complete time series is NA, and that missing values do not produce errors.\nAnother possibility to apply R functions to data cubes is of course to convert data cubes to stars objects and use the stars package for further analysis.\nApplying bfastmonitor as a user-defined reducer function\nIn our example, bfastmonitor returns change date and change magnitude values per time series so we can use reduce_time(). The script below (1) calculates the kNDVI, (2) applies bfastmonitor(), and properly handles errors e.g. due to missing data with tryCatch(), and (3) finally writes out the resulting change dates and magnitudes of change for all pixels of the time series as a netCDF file. The results shows the changes starting at 1/2019 until 12/2021 and identify pretty well the dynamical impacts of drought and bark beetle in the Marburg University Forest (MOF).\n\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(tmaptools)\nlibrary(gdalcubes)\nlibrary(stars)\nlibrary(colorspace)\nndvi.col = function(n) {\n  rev(sequential_hcl(n, \"Green-Yellow\"))\n}\ntutorialDir = path.expand(\"~/edu/agis/doc/data/tutorial/\")\n\nfigtrim &lt;- function(path) {\n  img &lt;- magick::image_trim(magick::image_read(path))\n  magick::image_write(img, path)\n  path\n}\ngdalcubes_options(parallel = 12)\n## start analysis\nsystem.time(\n  ncdf_cube(file.path(tutorialDir,\"MOF_10.nc\")) |&gt;\n    reduce_time(names = c(\"change_date\", \"change_magnitude\",\"kndvi\"), FUN = function(x) {\n      kndvi = tanh(((x['B08',]-x['B04',])/(x['B08',]+x['B04',]))^2)\n      if (all(is.na(kndvi))) {\n        return(c(NA,NA))\n      }\n      kndvi_ts = ts(kndvi, start = c(2017, 1), frequency = 12)\n      library(bfast)\n      tryCatch({\n        result = bfastmonitor(kndvi_ts, start = c(2020,1), \n                              history = \"all\", level = 0.01)\n        return(c(result$breakpoint, result$magnitude))\n      }, error = function(x) {\n        return(c(NA,NA))\n      })\n    }) |&gt;\n    write_ncdf(paste0(tutorialDir,\"bf_results.nc\"),overwrite = TRUE))\n\nNow we can use the netCDF file and map the results with any preferred visualisation tool. In this case tmap.\n\nlibrary(tmap)\n\nmask &lt;- raster(paste0(tutorialDir,\"forest/only_forestmask.tif\"))\n# plotting it from the local ncdf  \ntmap_mode(\"view\")\ngdalcubes::ncdf_cube(paste0(tutorialDir,\"bf_results.nc\")) |&gt;\n  stars::st_as_stars() -&gt; x\ntm_shape(osm_forest) + tm_rgb() +\n  tm_shape(x[1] * st_as_stars(mask )) + \n  tm_raster(n = 6)  +\n  tm_layout(\n    legend.show = TRUE,\n    panel.label.height=0.6,\n    panel.label.size=0.6,\n    legend.text.size = 0.4,\n    legend.outside = TRUE) +\n  tm_grid()\n\ntm_shape(osm_forest) + tm_rgb() +\n  tm_shape(x[2]* st_as_stars(mask ))  + tm_raster() +\n  tm_layout(legend.title.size = 1,\n            panel.label.height=0.6,\n            panel.label.size=0.6,\n            legend.text.size = 0.4,\n            legend.outside = TRUE) +\n  tm_grid()\n\n\n\n\nMagnitude Change Map\n\n\n\n\n\nPeriod of Change Map\n\nRunning bfastmonitor() is computationally expensive. However, since in common (not in our case) the data should be located in the cloud, it would be obvious to launch one of the (payed) more powerful machine instance types with many processors. Parallelization within one instance can be controlled entirely by gdalcubes using gdalcubes_options() which is extremely simple.\nFrom a scientific point of view we need to tune some aspects. The kNDVI Index together with the bfastmonitor approach is somewhat sophisticated and need a validation strategy. Also the correlation to the different tree species could be promising. So there is certainly a need for more analysis to understand the processes and to identify false results."
