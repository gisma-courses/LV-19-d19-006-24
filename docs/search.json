    "text": "One could claim that the fact living on the surface of the earth and only get to know a small space through direct personal experience is the most important motivation for most of the geographic work. Compensation for this lack of direct experience has been and is being made, especially in scientific geography, with the help of efficient spatio-temporal techniques of abstraction.\nKnowledge of spatial and/or temporal aspects of our environment is increasingly in demand for action-relevant relationships. Whether we ask as tourists, consumers, producers or planners spatial information, or even knowledge.\nGeographic Information Science (GIS) is based on versatile and powerful software tools that are used in modeling, analysis, data mining merging and numerous other spatio-temporal applications. Nevertheless the most powerful tool is our mind developing the concepts and developing the necessary algorithms.\n\nIntended learning outcomes\nAt the end of this course you should be able\n\nto understand, adapt and develop geographic information science methods\nto design workflows suitable to solve common spatio temporal data-related issues\nto deploy your workflows using geo-information science tools, R scripts and collaborative code management platforms for task management and issue tracking\nto critically evaluate your spatio-temporal analysis\nto communicate your workflow and analysis results\n\n\n\nCourse features\nThe course is intended as a blended learning module in our study program although the provided introductions, explanations and examples might be useful for self-study, too.\n\n\nDeliverables\nThe graded course certificate will be based on a team portfolio hosted as a team repository on GitHub. The individual portfolio items are defined in the respective course assignments along with the information if they will be marked or not. Marked portfolio items encompass the presentation and peer-review the paper which inform about the results of two problem solving assignments related to the computation and analysis of the geographic information systems products.\n\n\nPreparation and prerequisites\nThe courses assumes basic knowledge and skills in remote sensing and GIS."

    "text": "Tasks 1\n\nTask 01-01\nThis worksheet serves as an introduction to the different data models in GIS. You will also learn how to import your own spatial data into the GIS or how to create spatial data in the GIS, e.g. by digitising.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 01-01\n\n\n\n\nCreate a directory that is named without special characters and spaces (throughout the path/directory tree).\nCreate a QGIS project\nDownload the marburg_RE.tif file.\nFind out about the properties of the dataset. (projection, data model, range of values)\nCreate a subdirectory called Data as a subfolder of your project directory. Download the dataset containing Hesse from the geofabrik download page. Unzip this archive into the Data subfolder.\nAfter unzipping the archive, load the file gis_osm_pois_free_1.shp into your QGIS project.\nRead about the properties of this dataset. (projection, data model, range of values).\nCrop the gis_osm_pois_free_1 dataset to the size of the marburg_RE.tif aerial image.\nExport this point data in geopackage format under the name mr_points.\nImport the mr_objects.xls table (Spatial Objects dataset (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gisma-courses/geoinfo-basis-qgis/master/docs/assets/data/mr_objects.xls)) as a spatial layer into your QGIS project.\nCreate a spatial layer based on the aerial image marburg_RE.tif with the coordinate system EPSG:4326 WGS84:\n\nany three surfaces (filename mr_poly),\nany three polylines (filename mr_line)\nFinally, add 3 arbitrary positions (points) of your choice to the mr_points layer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 01-02\nUnfortunately, we cannot completely bypass the topic of the correct location of geodata sets - i.e. the appropriate projection. In Task 01-01 you imported raster and vector data into QGIS and created your own vector data. The spatial information of the data was available in geographic coordinates. The QGIS software you used always performs a real-time projection to project these spherical coordinates onto the flat monitor. This has nothing to do with a cartographically correct projection. As a rule of thumb, almost all spatial analysis methods and geometric calculations can only be performed on correctly projected data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nTo begin with, we can only urge you to keep the CRS (Coordinate Reference System) or KBS (Koordinatenbezugssystem) of your project and each data layer identical. For Germany the official system is ETRS89 UTM 32. This helps to avoid wrong positioning, one of the most common mistakes in the GIS world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 01-02\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new QGIS project. First load the raster file marburg_RE.tif and then the vector datasets mr_roads and mr_nat.\n\nWhat are the projections of each dataset?\nIn which projection are the data displayed?\nWhere can you define the projection used to display the data?\nWhat are the possible problems of an on-the-fly or real-time projection?"

    "section": "Assistance",
    "text": "Assistance\nWe would like to offer you some introductory help on QGIS as a concrete introduction to working on Task 1. QGIS is a complex software product that is not only available in different versions for all common operating systems, but is also completely customisable. For this reason, a large number of help files, manuals and tutorials have been circulating on the internet for the past 20 years - by no means will every Google hit be appropriate, nor will every tutorial be suitable for the version you are using.\nThe first port of call for specific information is the built-in help section of the software package. Extensive documentation is also available. The current QGIS Landing Page is the central access point to all documentation officially provided by the project.\nThe following applies to all help pages: be sure to look at the help for your version of QGIS. If it is not (yet) available, try the previous version and preferably the English help, as this is the reference for all translations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe transition from QGIS2.x to QGIS3.x has brought fundamental changes. QGIS 2.x tutorials and help are virtually useless as a concrete guide for the current version.\n\n\n\nSetting up a QGIS project\nFor computers with a home directory in the cloud/network (e.g. in university pools) it is strongly recommended to store the data on a local hard drive. To do this, you must first create a folder structure for your project. Help on the project file can be found in Working with project files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nMake sure you do not use any special characters, umlauts or spaces.\n\n\n\n\nDigitising Geometry Data\nThe manual creation of vector data is commonly referred to as digitising. You create your own vector-based datasets from raster image files such as satellite imagery, aerial photographs, thematic and topographic maps, simple screenshots or other templates. See the QGIS help for digitising. For a detailed application example, see Digitising forest stands.\n\n\nCropping vector data\nThis task is a good example of how difficult it can be to find help. Of course, you can always search the web. For example, try “crop vector data qgis”. You will get a lot of hits, but on closer inspection you will not find anything about cropping vector data using a raster file. What happens when you crop? You obviously need to tell a tool what you want to crop. Start again with this knowledge. Only this time use the toolbar and type “clip” or “clip”. Several hits will be displayed. One of them is Clip vector to extent. If you select this, you can choose three options for the extension…\n\n\nImporting tables into QGIS\nThere are a number of pitfalls when importing tables. In general, table data is only useful in QGIS if it contains either coordinates (i.e. geographic information) or a key such as an ID that can be assigned to existing geometry data. In general, however, they can follow the following scheme Importing spreadsheets or CSV files.\n\n\nWorking with projections\nThe chapter Working with projections is not easy for beginners. The correct assignment of projections is particularly important. For reprojecting vector data it is worth having a look at Reprojecting and transforming data."

    "text": "A watershed, also known as a catchment area or river basin, is the area from which precipitation flows into a particular river or watercourse and into which the river or watercourse drains. It is a natural hydrological unit defined by topographical features. Catchment modelling is an important aspect of water resources and environmental science for understanding the behaviour of the hydrological cycle and developing sustainable water management strategies.\nCatchment modelling allows the simulation of water flow, precipitation, runoff patterns and the transport of sediment and pollutants within the catchment. This is often done using hydrological models based on computer simulations. These models help to analyse different scenarios and environmental impacts, such as those associated with land use change, climate change or human activities.\nThe benefits of catchment modelling are many. They include predicting floods, assessing water quality, planning water management measures, identifying potential environmental impacts and developing strategies for sustainable water use. Understanding the dynamics of catchments is crucial to preventing water scarcity, protecting ecosystems and reconciling human activities with the environment."
