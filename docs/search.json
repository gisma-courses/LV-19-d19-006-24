    "text": "Spatial Patterns\nIn recent years, the ideas of analyzing spatial patterns have been extended through an approach called pattern-based spatial analysis (Long in in. 2010; Cardille in in. 2010; Cardille in in. 2012; Jasiewicz i in. 2013; Jasiewicz i in. 2015).\nThe fundamental idea is to divide a big area into a large number of smaller areas which we may call local landscapes patches.\n\n\n\nNote: The patch size is depending on spatial data resolution and scale of the landscape\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe idea is to represent each of this arbitrary areas using a statistical description of the spatial pattern - a spatial signature.\n\n\nThis spatial signatures can be compared using a large number of existing distance or dissimilarity measures (Lin 1991; Cha 2007), which enables spatial analyses such as searching, change detection, clustering, or segmentation."

In the context of spatial micro-scale analysis and modeling, the precise geo-object locations play a central role, presenting an additional challenge when considering the 3D structure. Incorporating the temporal aspect, such as accurately recording repeated flights, further elevates these demands. Whether utilizing low-cost or professional UAV systems, these factors must be acknowledged to enable meaningful analysis or modeling. While LiDAR systems are the preferred choice for acquiring forest structure, their high cost, both in acquisition and processing, poses challenges. A feasible alternative lies in off-the-shelf UAV systems with integrated image acquisition. These systems allow for the generation of not only orthorectified planar image data but also quasi-three-dimensional point clouds through photo reconstruction and image processing techniques, providing elevation information for each coordinate."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Ecology is the study of how organisms interact with each other and their environment. Scales and processes are two fundamental concepts in ecology that are used to understand ecological patterns and dynamics.\nScales in ecology refer to the spatial and temporal dimensions of ecological phenomena. Ecological phenomena occur at different scales, ranging from individual organisms to entire ecosystems and from seconds to millennia. Understanding the appropriate scale is crucial for understanding the ecological processes that occur within that scale. The selection of an appropriate scale also influences the accuracy and precision of ecological data and the interpretation of ecological patterns.\nProcesses in ecology refer to the biological and physical mechanisms that underlie ecological phenomena. Ecological processes occur at different scales, ranging from the molecular level to the landscape level. Ecological processes include biotic interactions, such as competition, predation, and mutualism, as well as abiotic interactions, such as climate, nutrient cycling, and disturbances. Understanding the underlying processes is essential for predicting how ecological systems will respond to changing conditions and for developing effective conservation and management strategies.\nOverall, scales and processes are essential concepts in ecology that are used to understand the complex interactions between organisms and their environment."

    "text": "Subsection\nAny study that examines the effects of area-based attributes on individual behaviors or outcomes faces another fundamental methodological problem besides the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). It is the problem that results about these effects can be affected by how contextual units or neighborhoods are geographically delineated and the extent to which these areal units deviate from the true geographic context. The problem arises because of the spatial uncertainty in the actual areas that exert the contextual influences under study and the temporal uncertainty in the timing and duration in which individuals experienced these contextual influences. Using neighborhood effects and environmental health research as a point of departure, this article clarifies the nature and sources of this problem, which is referred to as the uncertain geographic context problem (UGCoP). It highlights some of the inferential errors that the UGCoP might cause and discusses some means for mitigating the problem. It reviews recent studies to show that both contextual variables and research findings are sensitive to different delineations of contextual units. The article argues that the UGCoP is a problem as fundamental as the MAUP but is a different kind of problem. Future research needs to pay explicit attention to its potential confounding effects on research results and to methods for mitigating the problem (Kwan 2012).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: There are four lights"

    "text": "subsection\nTime can have a significant effect on scale in geography. This is because spatial relationships and patterns can change over time, and the appropriate scale to study a phenomenon may also change as a result. For example, the appropriate scale to study a natural disaster such as a hurricane may change as the storm approaches and intensifies, and then again as it makes landfall and moves inland. Similarly, the appropriate scale to study urban growth may change over time as the city expands and new neighborhoods or suburbs emerge.\nIn addition, the temporal scale at which data is collected and analyzed can also impact the understanding of geographic phenomena. For example, studying population changes over a decade may reveal different patterns and trends than studying changes over a single year.\nOverall, time is an important consideration in determining the appropriate scale to study a phenomenon and in interpreting the results of geographic analyses. It is essential to consider how spatial patterns and relationships change over time, and to collect and analyze data at appropriate temporal scales in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of geographic phenomena.\n\n3rd level\nYes, there are several theories in geography that relate to the effects of time on scale. One of the most well-known is the concept of temporal scale developed by geographer David Harvey. According to Harvey, temporal scale refers to the length of time over which a phenomenon can be observed, and it is an important consideration in understanding the spatial relationships and patterns that exist within a particular geographic context. In addition, Harvey argues that the temporal scale at which data is collected and analyzed can have a significant impact on the conclusions that can be drawn from the data.\nAnother theory related to the effects of time on scale is the concept of time-space compression developed by geographer David Harvey and others. This theory suggests that advances in technology and communication have led to a compression of time and space, making the world feel smaller and more connected. As a result, geographic phenomena may be influenced by factors that exist at different spatial and temporal scales, and it is important to consider these factors in analyzing and interpreting geographic data.\nOverall, the theories related to the effects of time on scale in geography highlight the complex and dynamic relationships between spatial and temporal phenomena, and the importance of considering these relationships in geographic analyses (Harvey 1996).\n\n4th level\nTime-space compression is a concept that has been developed and elaborated upon by several geographers, including David Harvey, Doreen Massey, and Henri Lefebvre. At its core, time-space compression refers to the idea that advances in transportation and communication technologies have created a sense of “shrinking” in terms of the time and space required for social and economic interactions.\nOne way in which time-space compression is manifested is through the increasing speed and ease of transportation and communication. For example, air travel, high-speed rail, and the internet have all made it possible to move goods, people, and information across vast distances in relatively short periods of time. This has led to a blurring of traditional spatial boundaries, and the emergence of global networks of exchange and interaction.\nHowever, time-space compression is not a neutral or uniform process, and its effects are felt differently by different people and in different places. For example, the increased speed of global trade may benefit some individuals and communities while harming others, and the intensification of global networks can lead to a sense of dislocation or disorientation for some people.\nOverall, time-space compression is an important concept in geography because it helps to explain how the spatial relationships and patterns that exist within a particular geographic context are shaped and transformed by technological change and globalization."

    "text": "Ecology is the study of how organisms interact with each other and their environment. Scales and processes are two fundamental concepts in ecology that are used to understand ecological patterns and dynamics.\nScales in ecology refer to the spatial and temporal dimensions of ecological phenomena. Ecological phenomena occur at different scales, ranging from individual organisms to entire ecosystems and from seconds to millennia. Understanding the appropriate scale is crucial for understanding the ecological processes that occur within that scale. The selection of an appropriate scale also influences the accuracy and precision of ecological data and the interpretation of ecological patterns.\nProcesses in ecology refer to the biological and physical mechanisms that underlie ecological phenomena. Ecological processes occur at different scales, ranging from the molecular level to the landscape level. Ecological processes include biotic interactions, such as competition, predation, and mutualism, as well as abiotic interactions, such as climate, nutrient cycling, and disturbances. Understanding the underlying processes is essential for predicting how ecological systems will respond to changing conditions and for developing effective conservation and management strategies.\nOverall, scales and processes are essential concepts in ecology that are used to understand the complex interactions between organisms and their environment."

    "text": "Subsection\nAny study that examines the effects of area-based attributes on individual behaviors or outcomes faces another fundamental methodological problem besides the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). It is the problem that results about these effects can be affected by how contextual units or neighborhoods are geographically delineated and the extent to which these areal units deviate from the true geographic context. The problem arises because of the spatial uncertainty in the actual areas that exert the contextual influences under study and the temporal uncertainty in the timing and duration in which individuals experienced these contextual influences. Using neighborhood effects and environmental health research as a point of departure, this article clarifies the nature and sources of this problem, which is referred to as the uncertain geographic context problem (UGCoP). It highlights some of the inferential errors that the UGCoP might cause and discusses some means for mitigating the problem. It reviews recent studies to show that both contextual variables and research findings are sensitive to different delineations of contextual units. The article argues that the UGCoP is a problem as fundamental as the MAUP but is a different kind of problem. Future research needs to pay explicit attention to its potential confounding effects on research results and to methods for mitigating the problem (Kwan 2012).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: There are four lights"

This is because spatial relationships and patterns can change over time, and the appropriate scale to study a phenomenon may also change as a result.

Compensation for this lack of direct experience has been and is being made, especially in scientific geography, with the help of efficient spatio-temporal techniques of abstraction.\nKnowledge of spatial and/or temporal aspects of our environment is increasingly in demand for action-relevant relationships. Whether we ask as tourists, consumers, producers or planners spatial information, or even knowledge.\nGeographic Information Science (GIS) is based on versatile and powerful software tools that are used in modeling, analysis, data mining merging and numerous other spatio-temporal applications. Nevertheless the most powerful tool is our mind developing the concepts and developing the necessary algorithms.\n\nIntended learning outcomes\nAt the end of this course you should be able\n\nto understand, adapt and develop geographic information science methods\nto design workflows suitable to solve common spatio temporal data-related issues\nto deploy your workflows using geo-information science tools, R scripts and collaborative code management platforms for task management and issue tracking\nto critically evaluate your spatio-temporal analysis\nto communicate your workflow and analysis results\n\n\n\nCourse features\nThe course is intended as a blended learning module in our study program although the provided introductions, explanations and examples might be useful for self-study, too.\n\n\nDeliverables\nThe graded course certificate will be based on a team portfolio hosted as a team repository on GitHub. The individual portfolio items are defined in the respective course assignments along with the information if they will be marked or not. Marked portfolio items encompass the presentation and peer-review the paper which inform about the results of two problem solving assignments related to the computation and analysis of the geographic information systems products.\n\n\nPreparation and prerequisites\nThe courses assumes basic knowledge and skills in remote sensing and GIS."
