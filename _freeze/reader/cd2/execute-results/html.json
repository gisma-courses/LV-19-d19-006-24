An ever-growing number of websites, R packages and tutorials support this data access and thus lower a significant barrier to entry.\n\nBelow you will find a preliminary and unorganized list of links that provide access to packages, data and tutorials. Most of the links lead directly to the corresponding example code.\n\n* Common approaches\n   * [rspatialdata](https://rspatialdata.github.io/) from Paula Moraga and Laurie Baker is a extremely useful collection of data sources and tutorials on downloading and visualising spatial data using R.\n   * [packages to download open spatial data](https://www.paulamoraga.com/book-spatial/r-packages-to-download-open-spatial-data.html) Same author as before very brief and effective introduction to this topic\n   * [acesss to reanalysis](https://dominicroye.github.io/en/2018/access-to-climate-reanalysis-data-from-r/)\n* Specific packages\n  * [easyclimate](https://verughub.github.io/easyclimate/)\n  * [online weather data](https://r4photobiology.info/galleries/online-weather-data.html)\n  * [climate4R](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/climate4R)\n  * [cstools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CSTools/index.html))\n  * [naturalearthdata](https://docs.ropensci.org/rnaturalearthdata/)\n  * [soilDB](https://ncss-tech.github.io/soilDB/)\n  * [geodata](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geodata/index.html)\n  * [rdwd](https://bookdown.org/brry/rdwd/) DWD data access\n* Data providers\n  * [cmsaf](https://www.cmsaf.eu/EN/Products/Tools/R/R_node.html)\n  * [ropensci](https://ropensci.org/packages/data-access/)\n  * [openeo](https://openeo.org/documentation/1.0/r/#full-example)\n  \n* Tutorials  \n   * [pRecipe](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pRecipe/vignettes/case_study.html)\n   * [Earth System Science Course](https://pjbartlein.github.io/REarthSysSci/overview.html)\n   * [dealing with netCDF](https://pjbartlein.github.io/REarthSysSci/netCDF.html)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Final Remarks\n\n\n",
